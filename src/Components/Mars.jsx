        <p>
          This is because Mars is covered in soil, rock, and dust made from iron
          oxide which gives the surface a red rusty colour.

        <p>
          They are named after the two horses that pull the Roman god of war,
          Mars’, chariot. They may be asteroids captured by Mars’ gravity.

        <p>
          It is 227,936,637 km (141 million miles) away from the sun. It would
          take 300 days (around 8 months) to get there from Earth.

        <p>
          This makes it the second smallest planet in our solar system. A day on
          Mars lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes.
