        <p>
          This is because Mars is covered in soil, rock, and dust made from iron
          oxide which gives the surface a red rusty colour.

        <h2>Mars is named after the Roman god of war</h2>
        <p>
          In ancient Roman religion and myth, Mars (Latin: Mārs, pronounced
          [maːrs])[4] was the god of war and also an agricultural guardian, a
          combination characteristic of early Rome.[5] He was the son of Jupiter
          and Juno, and was pre-eminent among the Roman army's military gods.
          Most of his festivals were held in March, the month named for him
          (Latin Martius), and in October, which began the season for military
          campaigning and ended the season for farming.

        <p>
          They are named after the two horses that pull the Roman god of war,
          Mars’, chariot. They may be asteroids captured by Mars’ gravity.

        <p>
          It is 227,936,637 km (141 million miles) away from the sun. It would
          take 300 days (around 8 months) to get there from Earth.

        <p>
          This makes it the second smallest planet in our solar system. A day on
          Mars lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes.
