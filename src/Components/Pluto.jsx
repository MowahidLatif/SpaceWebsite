        <h2>Pluto was discovered while searching for planet X.</h2>
        <p>
          Pluto was discovered on February 18, 1930 by astronomer Clyde
          Tombaugh, who worked with the Lowell Observatory telescope. He was
          looking for planet X — a hypothetical celestial body that affects the
          orbit of Uranus. Tombaugh used a blink comparator, a device that
          compares two images of the same part of the sky to detect shifting
          objects which may turn out to be yet undiscovered planets. Pluto was
          found in photographs taken by Clyde Tombaugh on January 28 and 29,
          1930.

        <h2>Pluto could had been discovered decades earlier</h2>
        <p>
          As is often the case in astronomy, Tombaugh was not the first to see
          Pluto. Its image was earlier obtained in a photograph taken by Edward
          Barnard in 1909. But the object of his observations was not searching
          for planets, but Halley’s Comet. Therefore, the astronomer had no
          chance to realize that a small dot on the photographic plate was not
          one of many stars, but something more uncommon.

          After the discovery of the new celestial body, various scientists have
          proposed a number of variants of its name. They included Zeus,
          Minerva, Cronus, and Percival — in honor of Percival Lowell, founder
          of the Lowell Observatory and the main sponsor of the search for
          planet X.{" "}

          The discovery of Pluto was made due to an error in the calculations
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because astronomers could not view Pluto’s disk even with the most
          powerful telescopes, it has been supposed for many decades that it was
          similar in mass to Earth, but had a very dark surface that reflected
          almost no light. That all changed in 1978, when American
          astrophysicist James Christie discovered that Pluto has at least one
          satellite (named Charon).

        <h2>Sometimes Pluto gets closer to the Sun than Neptune</h2>
        <p>
          Pluto’s orbit is very different from the orbits of planets of the
          solar system — it has a much greater eccentricity and inclination to
          the plane of the ecliptic. In aphelion it moves away from the Sun by
          7.3 billion km, and in perihelion it approaches it by 4.4 billion km.
          This is less than the distance between the Sun and Neptune. Thus,
          during each turn, Pluto for some time gets closer to the Sun than
          Neptune. The previous such event took place since 1979 to 1999, the
          next time it will take place since 2227 to 2247.
