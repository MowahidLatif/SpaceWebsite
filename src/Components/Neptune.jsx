        <h2>Neptune is the Most Distant Planet</h2>
        <p>
          This may sound like a pretty simple statement, but it’s actually
          rather complicated. When it was first discovered by in 1846, Neptune
          became the most distant planet in the Solar System. But then in 1930,
          Pluto was discovered, and Neptune became the second-most distant
          planet. But Pluto’s orbit is very elliptical; and so there are periods
          when Pluto actually orbits closer to the Sun than Neptune. The last
          time this happened was in 1979, which lasted until 1999. During that
          period, Neptune was again the most distant planet{" "}

        <h2>Neptune is the Smallest of the Gas Giants</h2>
        <p>
          With an equatorial radius of only 24,764 km, Neptune is smaller than
          all the other gas giants in the Solar System: Jupiter, Saturn and
          Uranus. But here’s the funny thing: Neptune is actually more massive
          than Uranus by about 18%. Since it’s smaller but more massive, Neptune
          has a much higher density than Uranus. In fact, at 1.638 g/cm3,
          Neptune is the densest gas giant in the Solar System.

        <h2>Neptune’s Surface Gravity is Almost Earth-like</h2>
        <p>
          Neptune is a ball of gas and ice, probably with a rocky core. There’s
          no way you could actually stand on the surface of Neptune without just
          sinking in. However, if you could stand on the surface of Neptune, you
          would notice something amazing. The force of gravity pulling you down
          is almost exactly the same as the force of gravity you feel walking
          here on Earth.{" "}

        <h2>The Discovery of Neptune is Still a Controversy</h2>
        <p>
          The first person to have seen Neptune was likely Galileo, who marked
          it as a star in one of his drawings. However, since he did not
          identify it as a planet, he is not credited with the discovery. That
          credit goes to French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier and the English
          mathematician John Couch Adams, both of whom predicted that a new
          planet – known as Planet X – would be discovered in a specific region
          of the sky.

        <h2>Neptune has the Strongest Winds in the Solar System</h2>
        <p>
          Think a hurricane is scary? Imagine a hurricane with winds that go up
          to 2,100 km/hour. As you can probably imagine, scientists are puzzled
          how an icy cold planet like Neptune can get its cloud tops t0 move so
          fast. One idea is that the cold temperatures and the flow of fluid
          gasses in the planet’s atmosphere might reduce friction to the point
          that it’s easy to generate winds that move so quickly.{" "}
