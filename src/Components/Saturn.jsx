        <h2>Galileo Galilei's Contribution to Saturn</h2>
        <p>
          Galileo Galilei first observed Saturn in 1610, however, his telescope
          failed to observe the planet’s rings. The discovery of the rings was
          made by Christiaan Huygens in 1659.

        <h2>Saturn and the other planets</h2>
        <p>
          Out of the five visible planets ( Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter ),
          Saturn is the most distant from Earth. It is around 10 times farther
          away from us than we are from the Sun.

        <h2>How fast Light travels</h2>
        <p>
          Light takes about 1 hour and 29 minutes to travel from Saturn and then
          arrive at us.

        <h2>Ammonia and Saturns color?</h2>
        <p>
          The presence of ammonia gives Saturn a yellow appearance, ammonia
          hydrosulfide – orange, and water – white.

        <h2>Saturns different tempered poles</h2>
        <p>
          Since Saturn’s axial tilt is similar to Earth, the southern and
          northern hemispheres are heated differently. Much of these variations
          in temperature are horizontal.
