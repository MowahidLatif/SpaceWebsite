        <h2>Mercury orbits the Sun faster than any other planet</h2>
        <p>
          The planet’s closeness to the Sun makes Mercury’s orbit shorter than
          those of any other planet in the Solar System. One year in Mercury is
          only about 88 Earth days. That is less than three months.

        <h2>Mercury was named after the Roman god of commerce</h2>
        <p>
          Because Mercury’s orbit is so small, it seems like it’s moving faster
          in the sky than other planets. This is why the Romans named it after
          their fasted god, Mercury, who is sometimes also depicted as a quick
          messenger with a winged helmet. Mercury was also the god of commerce,
          finance, communication, and eloquence.

        <h2>Mercury has some extreme temperature changes</h2>
        <p>
          Also because of its weak atmosphere, Mercury can’t contain any of the
          heat coming from the Sun, so it goes through some wild temperature
          changes. By day the surface temperature can reach 800 °F (427 °C) but
          at night it can drop down to -269 °F (−173 °C).

        <h2>The days are very long in Mercury</h2>
        <p>
          Mercury rotates very slowly around its axis. One Mercurial day takes
          almost 59 Earth days. I don’t know about you but I would be angry if I
          had to wait almost two months to go to bed.

        <h2>There is a piece of Mercury here on Earth</h2>
        <p>
          In 2012 a green meteorite was found being sold at a street market
          Morocco. After studying its composition, astronomers believe it might
          have come from Mercury as it matches the data we have of Mercury sent
          by the MESSENGER probe. The meteorite could have arrived after one of
          the many impacts on Mercury sent some pieces of it flying into space.
