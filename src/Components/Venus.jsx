        <h2>A day on Venus is longer than a year</h2>
        <p>
          It takes Venus longer to rotate once on its axis than to complete one
          orbit of the Sun. That’s 243 Earth days to rotate once – the longest
          rotation of any planet in the Solar System – and only 224.7 Earth days
          to complete an orbit of the Sun.

        <h2>
          Venus is hotter than Mercury – despite being further away from the Sun
        </h2>
        <p>
          Its mean temperature is 462°C. This is because of the high
          concentration of carbon dioxide in Venus’ atmosphere, which works to
          produce an intense greenhouse effect. Heat is trapped in the
          atmosphere like a blanket, causing the temperature of the planet to be
          much higher than its proximity to the Sun would suggest.

        <h2>
          Unlike the other planets in our solar system, Venus spins clockwise on
          its axis
        </h2>
        <p>
          All other planets spin anti-clockwise on their axis and orbit the Sun
          in an anti-clockwise direction. Venus also orbits the Sun
          anti-clockwise, but its unusual axis rotation is due to being upside
          down – it was knocked off its upright position earlier in its history!

          Venus is the second brightest natural object in the night sky after
          the Moon
        </h2>
        <p>
          The clouds of sulphuric acid in Venus’ atmosphere make it reflective
          and shiny, obscuring our view of its surface. Its brightness makes it
          visible even during the day – if it’s clear and you know where to
          look.

        <h2>
          Venus was the first planet to have its motions plotted across the sky,
          as early as the second millennium BC
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because Venus is easy to spot with the naked eye, it is impossible to
          say who discovered the planet. But over the centuries we have been
          able to measure Venus’ motions, including the rare transit of Venus,
          when the planet appears to cross in front of the Sun.
