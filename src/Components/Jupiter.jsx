        <p>
          Jupiter is the biggest planet in our solar system with a radius of
          69,911 km. It is more than twice as big as all the other planets
          combined.

        <h2>Jupiter has rings, but they’re too faint to see very well</h2>
        <p>
          Saturn and Uranus aren’t the only planets with rings. Jupiter has them
          too but they are so faint we can’t really see them.

        <h2>Jupiter has 80 moons</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter has 80 moons that we know of, it might have even more.
          Fifty-seven moons have been given official names by the International
          Astronomical Union (IAU). Another 23 moons are awaiting official
          names.

        <h2>Jupiter is a Gas Giant</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter is a gas giant because it is made mostly of gases hydrogen and
          helium.

        <h2>There are clouds on Jupiter</h2>
        <p>
          Jupiter has powerful storms and even has lightning strikes. They are
          sites of strong upward motion of the air, which leads to the formation
          of bright and dense clouds that make Jupiter appear very beautiful.
