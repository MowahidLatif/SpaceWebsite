        <h2>Plate Tectonics Keep the Planet Comfortable.</h2>
        <p>
          Earth is the only planet in the Solar System with plate tectonics.
          Basically, the outer crust of the Earth is broken up into regions
          known as tectonic plates. These are floating on top of the magma
          interior of the Earth and can move against one another. When two
          plates collide, one plate will subduct (go underneath another), and
          where they pull apart, they will allow fresh crust to form.{" "}

        <h2>Earth is Almost a Sphere</h2>
        <p>
          Many people tend to think that the Earth is a sphere. In fact, between
          the 6th cenury BCE and the modern era, this remained the scientific
          consensus. But thanks to modern astronomy and space travel, scientists
          have since come to understand that the Earth is actually shaped like a
          flattened sphere (aka. an oblate spheroid).

        <h2>Earth is Mostly Iron, Oxygen and Silicon.</h2>
        <p>
          If you could separate the Earth out into piles of material, you’d get
          32.1 % iron, 30.1% oxygen, 15.1% silicon, and 13.9% magnesium. Of
          course, most of this iron is actually located at the core of the
          Earth. If you could actually get down and sample the core, it would be
          88% iron. And if you sampled the Earth’s crust, you’d find that 47% of
          it is oxygen.

        <h2>70% of the Earth’s Surface is Covered in Water</h2>
        <p>
          When astronauts first went into the space, they looked back at the
          Earth with human eyes for the first time. Based on their observations,
          the Earth acquired the nickname the “Blue Planet:. And it’s no
          surprise, seeing as how 70% of our planet is covered with oceans. The
          remaining 30% is the solid crust that is located above sea level,
          hence why it is called the “continental crust”.{" "}

        <h2>The Earth’s Atmosphere Extends to a Distance of 10,000 km</h2>
        <p>
          Earth’s atmosphere is thickest within the first 50 km from the surface
          or so, but it actually reaches out to about 10,000 km into space. It
          is made up of five main layers – the Troposphere, the Stratosphere,
          the Mesosphere, the Thermosphere, and the Exosphere. As a rule, air
          pressure and density decrease the higher one goes into the atmosphere
          and the farther one is from the surface.{" "}
