        <h2>Uranus is the first planet discovered in modern times</h2>
        <p>
          Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. However, it is the first
          planet whose discoverer is known to us. Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter
          and Saturn were well known to the ancient Greeks. As for the other
          planets, humanity was not aware of them until the 18th century.

        <h2>Uranus was named after the ancestor of gods and titans</h2>
        <p>
          Uranus was named after the Greek god of the sky, the son of Chaos.
          This is the only planet named not after the Roman god, but his Greek
          counterpart. According to myths, all the other great celestial bodies,
          including Pluto and Ceres, are his children, grandchildren or
          great-grandchildren. And only Gaia-Earth is his sister.

          The average distance from Uranus to the Sun is 2.8 billion km. Because
          of this, one rotation around the luminary takes 84 terrestrial years.
          There is a change of seasons on the planet, and in 2007 it had the
          vernal equinox (for the northern hemisphere).{" "}

        <h2>One can test his or her eyesight with Uranus</h2>
        <p>
          Despite the fact that Uranus is located far from the Sun and had
          eluded astronomers for many centuries, it is still possible to see it
          with the naked eye. The apparent magnitude of the planet ranges from
          5.7 to 6.0.

        <h2>Uranus is a rolling planet</h2>
        <p>
          The inclination of the equator of Uranus to the plane of its orbit is
          97°. This means that the planet is moving, as if lying on its side
          being turned slightly “upside down”. It could be said that it “rolls”
          along its orbit, but the direction of rotation is the opposite of what
          an imaginable wheel would have in this case.{" "}
